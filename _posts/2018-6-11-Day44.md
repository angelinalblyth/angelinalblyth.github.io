## Start of week 5

Start of week 5 and we had our usual standup letting everyone know how we got on over the weekend. Most people had made a solid dent in their code which is great.

I spent the first 10 minutes with John going over the error message I had with my code, all it was was a missing equals sign from from Sinatra code which was frustrating as hell!

The rest of today was spent on changing some HTML so it was all consistent and semantic. Yesterday I had just done a lot of printing to the screen with p tags but I went through all my show and index's and printed out the information from the database in a table format. This made all the information printing from the screen the same which I am sure will be better for the user.
