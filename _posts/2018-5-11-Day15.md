## Last Day of work 	

This is my last day of work and I will be leaving @ 3pm. I did have a slight panic that I hadn't done a part of the precourse work by building a website and sending it over to one of the Codeclan staff. I just quickly flung my portfolio pages for FreeCodeCamp over after a few tweaks here and there. Taking a few days off before I start on Monday.
