## Looking back over the homework

Today I decided to go back over this weekends homework  by just creating another folder with the blank files in it, redo the problems and see how far I could get to. Again I stumbled upon the array and hashes which is starting to annoy me know that I cant seem to figure these out. I don't know how to start thinking about them differently, if its just a matter of doing more examples of them.

I got stuck on the same ones that I had previously, I looked at the code I had written and honestly didn't know how I had go to that point. I hope that they various things we have already done sink in soon or else I feel like I may start to fall behind.

On to the next week which by the looks of it will be tough as there are a lot of new jargon that I don't recognise.
