## Finishing the game

So today is the last day of week 2 at CodeClan. We started with letting everyone know how we found this week. Was a bit of a mixed bad of ups and downs, I did struggle towards the start of the week but it has gotten better as the weeks went on.

We had our one to ones with Kat today to see how we are getting on with the course, if we have any issues with the course and how we are getting on generally.

We also finished off the snacks and ladders game we were building, due to me being out with Kat I kind of missed chunk and couldn't quite get back up to speed with it. At lunch we had the director of Oxido come in and give a talk, he has already taken on two CodeClan students and really sees the benefit of employing someone that has been through the course which was great to hear.

After our talk we got our homework and where free to leave if we wanted. I stayed behind for a few hours to get some planning done for the homework, which is to make a Karaoke Bar, with guests, rooms and different songs. Sounds like a fairly easy thing to build but its usually deceiving.
