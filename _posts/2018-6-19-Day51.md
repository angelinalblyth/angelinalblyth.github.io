## ArrayLists meh!

This week is already becoming the toughest week for me. Seems like I have went straight back to the very beginning and know nothing about anything programming language, like what even is a variable? I am genuinely not kidding when I say that.

Todays lesson we went over more knew things in Java, arrays and ArrayLists. With Ruby we had it so simple, we could just make arrays with whatever we wanted in them, Java not so much. Our morning was filled with ArrayLists and I feel no further forward with them.

Our afternoon was filled with a paired programming lab. Our lab was to build an airport flight manager, we have to create an Airplane class, this has destination, passengers and we could board passengers onto the plane.

I really am struggling with the ArrayLists part of Java, it just doesn't seem to want to go in somehow. The lab I found really tough. Its only Tuesday and I am close to throwing in the towel.

I also thought that while here we would get one to one's with the student advisor but that doesn't seem like the case, we had that a few weeks ago back in ruby but we haven't had that since.
