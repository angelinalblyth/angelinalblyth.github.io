## Time for our Presentations

So today is the day I think most of the class have been dreading and that is standing up in front of each other and discussing our sites. I think most of us wanted to get ours over and done with, few luckily people got to go up almost first thing. I still hadn't had my go by lunchtime which was horrible, I had to wait until practically the very end. I don't even think I did my full 15 minutes, I rattled through it quite quickly and luckily there wasn't many questions.

I am so glad that is over for another 4 weeks. Don't think that will get any easier to do no matter how many times you do it.

I really learned a lot from each of the presentations, so many fantastics sites. Everyone has come on so far in the last few weeks it really is great to see. Just shows you how good the lectures are in their teaching that everyones was able to make a functioning website. I think everyone had the same struggle and that was with the CSS but truthfully everyones sites looked amazing even with minimal CSS.

I have tomorrow off thankfully! Will be a day to catch up on things outside CodeClan, perhaps catch up on this blog and just mentally chill out before starting Java next week.
