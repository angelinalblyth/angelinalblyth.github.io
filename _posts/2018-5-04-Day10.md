## Enjoying the weekend    

So off work today and I am heading up to Aberdeen for the weekend. I downloaded pdf versions of Chris Pines 'Learn to Program' ebook to work on while I travel up.

I managed to get through the first 6 chapters.I managed to do a few of the 'Try this' sections but then I just couldn't think of how to get things down. I sort of know what I wanted to do but I couldn't write it out.

Going to just continue to work through the book and then possibly go back after I have read it all.
