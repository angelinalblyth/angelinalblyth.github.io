## Ruby Ruby Ruby

Spending today trying to get through the rest of the ruby course on codecademy. Hopefully get it finished today and then I'll need t o go on the hunt for some more learnings courses to go over everything again.

I'll still keep up the Solo Learn app in the mornings.

Don't think Ill be able to do any coding tomorrow due to my Grassroots over at Alloa.
