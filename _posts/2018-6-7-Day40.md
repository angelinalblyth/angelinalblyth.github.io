## User Experience Design   

So today was a full day away from out laptops. We had the lovely and funny [Wojtek](https://twitter.com/wojtekkutyla) visiting us today to give us a full day of UX and how it is essential for web development.

We learned -

1. What UX is.
2. How and Why it is important.
3. About -
  1. User needs
  2. Business needs
  3. Constraints
4. Methods and how to apply them
5. Follow basic guidelines

It all boils down to -

THE GIST IS:

IN ORDER TO DEVELOP GOOD
SOFTWARE YOU NEED TO CARE
ABOUT UX. AT LEAST A BIT.

We did some practical work on making personas for out applications, user needs, user journeys and wireframes.

I really learned a lot from Wojtek, things that I have learned back in February. I attended a talk on Accessibility by [Stuart Ashworth](https://twitter.com/stuartashworth9) at this years DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper.

I struggled with trying to think of people for my personas, I am really not a very imaginative person. I can see the real benefit for our projects here at CodeClan, and I have done some similar thing in previous jobs but perhaps not to this degree.

After todays lesson we where handed out the specs for our Projects which we will be starting tomorrow. Not going to take a look at these tonight, wait until tomorrow.
