## And we are off!  

So today started with our first ever stand-up which happens regularly at developer offices. I think most of the group had difficulties (perhaps a strong word for it) with the [Where is Sandy?](https://alistairkane92.github.io/where_is_sandy/) game. Everyone seemed to be looking forward to what was in store today.

Back in the classroom we went over yesterdays homework and went through the game, each of us being ask a question. Then it was onto functions, conditionals and how we test our programs.

I had never done that type of testing before, mostly my tests have been refresh the page and check to see if it looks correct or the output has changed so that was fun to learn.

We ended up the day with a lab and we did this in pairs for some pair programming. Jack who I was paired up with is some sort of maths genius, the last few functions we had to create I would have spend a good 30 minutes googling the equations. We managed to get through the entire lab and the extra stuff at the end which was good as it was our homework!

Thats it for today, back home and watching some a git course on Advanced Git by [Nina](https://twitter.com/nnja) on [FrontEndMasters](https://twitter.com/nnja).
