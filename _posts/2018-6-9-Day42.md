## Thankful for others

So this morning I head off to the library to meet up with Derek, Matt, Harjit and Tara from the course. Together we would be able to sit around, work on our planning and projects and if we got stuck anywhere we would be able to give each other a hand.

This really helped me mentally. I am so thankful for them being here and if I was struggling with something they could easily pinpoint the error. Some of these errors you look at for 10 mins or hours and you cant see what it is thats wrong, someone else can look at it and just read the error and they know right away what it is. Once you know the error nine times out of 10 I feel a bit stupid because I know what the error was but I just couldn't see it because I had been staring at it for so long.  

I sort of gave up coding after a few hours and just helped some of the others on what they where working on or getting stuck on. My head just was not in it. Going to pick it back up again tomorrow back at the library.
