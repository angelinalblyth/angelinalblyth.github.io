## 100DaysOfCode

Today was my introduction to Code Clan. Arriving at the new offices for CodeClan I was a mixture of exited and nervous. We went through a sort of ice-breaker to get to know our fellow classmates, each person seems really nice and no doubt will bring a lot to the class rooms and learning experience.

We got some information regarding out Pre-Course work, a small tour of the building, out pictures taken and when we should be there on the start date.

Not having used a mac much I think I will struggle for a bit on how to navigate around it so I am going to really try and learn as much as I can and do as much as I can on my MAC so I am ready in three weeks time.
