## Loops in Functions

So day 3 of CodeClan I personally feel like things have ramped up a fair bit.

We had a nice late start today so we had a lot of information to take in during the afternoon lesson.

We first started out with arrays, how to create them, get information from them, add to them and remove things from them. It all seemed fairly straight forward. Next we moved onto Hashes, this is where you can create a 'key' and give it a 'value'. I suspect hashes are used a lot in programming. Next it was onto loops so that we don't repeat ourselves(DRY). All three on its own are fairly simple but after all that we moved onto loops within functions.

After some quick demos with chickens and counting eggs it was homework time.

I sat in the class and worked on the homework for a few hours. The first few exercises where quick and easy to do, I mentally gave myself high fives for each one that was correct. However, I had been too quick on the high fives as it got increasingly more difficult. I spent roughly 20 minutes on one particular problem and I got so frustrated with myself. I eventually had to move onto the next task.

Not long just finished the homework and handed it in. Few things I will probably have to go over again tomorrow but I did eventually get the one problem I was stuck on to work which is fantastic.

Looking forward to what tomorrow brings
