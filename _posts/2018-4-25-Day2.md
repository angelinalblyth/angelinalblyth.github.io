## Figuring out Jekyll

So today I wanted to try and learn how to combine my github.io pages and Jekyll. Well you are reading this on my github.io pages so I guess it figured it out ;)

Been learning more about Ruby with Codeacademy and boy it is tough. Learned more about Arrays and Hashes. Even helped out a fellow cohort person that was struggling with a challenge. I find doing that helps me learn, trying to explain it to someone else.

Perhaps I should get one of those ducks to talk to when things get tough.
