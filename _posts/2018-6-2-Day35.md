## Added stresses

So the course is going well, I am enjoying what we are learning, there have been some down times where I have felt frustrated and not getting something. I am dealing with all of that but the biggest stressor for me right now is trying to find a flat before the end of my lease. It is all I am thinking about currently as the date looms ever closer. I went and seen a couple of flat-shares today and I have been to see a few flats during the week too but I just cant seem to find anything that suits yet. This is giving me some bad anxiety and whenever the other half is phoning me I can tell I am taking it out in him but there is no one else for me to talk to about this. 

Anyway apart from that todays weather was lovely. I got myself something to eat in-between flat viewings and say down in a grassy bit near the Clyde, just off of St Enochs and watched people going about their lives, I even did some coding while I was there. Was all very relaxing.

Added some bits and pieces to my Cinema but then I was met with mass amounts of errors so I just checked out all the changes and stated fresh. Leaving it to tomorrow when I can just chill and concentrate on it.
