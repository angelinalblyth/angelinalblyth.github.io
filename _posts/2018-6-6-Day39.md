## Model-View-Controller (MVC)   

This morning we went over last nights homework as most people seemed to  get stuck on the same part, the edit and updating of a customer or pizza order. Not to sure I fully get it but hopefully with a bit more practice I will.

We went over some CSS basics including flexbox. I really need to finish the course I started on Front End Masters for it as I think it will now come in handy, perhaps thats for the weeekend.

We then started the lab of creating Hogwarts, filled with students and their respective houses. Everything was going fine until I got to adding in the second table for houses and thats when all the errors appeared. Think I was starting at the same error when it was an extra comma at the end of the create table in my SQL file.

Managed to get there in the end so its all good. Going to work tonight on making it look good now that I have everything printing to the pages.
