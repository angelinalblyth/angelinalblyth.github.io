## Officially started CodeClan today

Up bright and early this morning as I officially start CodeClan today. Got to meet the rest of my cohort, those that didnt manage to make the Meet You Cohort. Then we went over some introduction like things, where the fireexits are, our badges to enter t he building and we made up our own Class Rules.

One of which is no Taekwon-Do but Tai Chi is, means I wont be able to practice my round house kicks...oh well.

In the afternoon we went over some Unix and Command Line basics. This was gone over in the pre-course work however it is always good to get some practice in.

We rounded off today with some homework to take away with us. Some people choose to sit in the class and work on it a little, like myself. There was a task to go over the command line basics and create/modify and upload a new directory to GitHub.

There was then a little game that allowed us to practice changing directories quickly, I actually found it rather difficult so I hope I can wrap my head around it and remember how to do it again. I might bookmark the game as reference.

Finally we got a group photo of us all. Meet the G6 Family
