## Frustrated with Ruby

Attended GlasgowCoderCollective's weekly meetup @ Cali University. Was nice to have a space to just sit, code and chat with others on the same journey as me.

Worked on more hashes and symbols today and managed to complete sections 6 of 'Learn Ruby' on codecademy.

Still finding it really tough but I am going to persevere.
