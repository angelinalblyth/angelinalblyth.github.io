## Working on the homework

This afternoon I worked on the homework for a bit. Managed to get all my classes build, some tests passing and I started to work on the extensions. I seem to have gotten stuck on something that I know will be really really simple but I am just over complicating it. Time to put the laptop away and chill out for the rest of the evening, I'll come back to it tomorrow.
