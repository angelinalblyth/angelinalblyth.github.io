title: Day 7 Finished Ruby Finally!
---


## On to the next ones  

I finished the Ruby section on CodeCademy and I have moved onto the command line course. It seems easy enough, and I have learned a few more shortcuts from when I did the intro to Unix course which I am sure will be helpful.

Also had a meeting with my now new manager and he said to me that during CodeClans employee parts that I will get the chance to come over to DPD and sit with the various teams and learn a bit about what everyone does. Looking forward to that.

The stress from trying to get a job wouldnt have been good for me I dont think so I am very lucky to not need to worry about all of that athough I think it would have been good for networking but then there are always events to meet new people.
