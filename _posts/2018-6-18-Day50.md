## Week 6 Lets be having you!

So this week starts our Java sections of CodeClan. Looking forward and also dreading this, never seen any syntax to do with Java and there seems to be a fair few people in the class that has some some Java.

Today we started with learning the difference between Static and Dynamic Programming and then what a integrated development environment (IDE) is. I have used an IDE before when I did the first few weeks of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) back when I was self learning. We are using a program called IntelliJ, which seems like a JetBrains piece of software. It came up on mines to start a 30 day trial and I just clicked 'yes' so I am sure that will come to bit me somehow when the trial ends.

We built our first app in Java, a simple print to screen that a cat 'meows'.
