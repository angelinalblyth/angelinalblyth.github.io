## Start of Week 3 at CodeClan

Finished the homework yesterday and I went to add some extras onto it but I just had enough and I put the laptop away.

So today we started Week 3 of CodeClan and the agenda for this week is Introducing SQL. Wasn't too sure if the syntax would be the same as normal SQL and I was pleasantly surprised it was. We started off with creating some tables and figuring out what the relationship of these tables where. We built a Star Wars database with some characters and lightsabers.

For homework today we had to write some queries to bring back certain things from a Marvel Movies database. Found it fairly easy which was good after the first two weeks being tough.

Looking forward to what the rest of the week has in store.
