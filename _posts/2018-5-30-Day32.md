## One To Many relationship

We went through last nights homework with the majority of people choosing Netflix. We ended up with around 10 tables, and that was mainly user tables and some film tables didn't even go over what the possible tables would be for TV shows. With the many to many tables we had to do join tables for them with foreign keys to bring them together.

Todays lesson what working more on our Pizza Shop from yesterday. Now that we had our Pizza Orders it was time to add the customer and remove their details from the Pizza Orders and just have them referenced as a foreign key.

Our lab for the afternoon was to build something that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records. This was fairly straight forward. We had two classes, album and artist. Working through CRUD for each of these. We also had to create methods that allowed us to edit, find and delete certain artists and or albums. I got stuck on the deleting an artist if they where already assigned to an album, tried a few things but eventually gave up. Continuing with this afternoons lab was tonights homework, I gave up trying to figure out how to delete an artist that was already assigned to an album. Something to go over tomorrow.
