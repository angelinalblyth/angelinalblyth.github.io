## Quick check on UX

First thing this morning I had booked a slot with Wojtek. I was pretty please with my code so far but he tore out a few things and said there was ways to do it better. So back to the drawing board with those. I forked my repo and worked on the things that he has said needed changed. It took me a long time to get it looking the way I wanted it after that and there was one thing that I couldn't get to work so I just reverted it back to how it was.

I started to think of adding on extensions but my head just was not in it with the way I was feeling. I had MVP and it was looking pretty good in my opinion so I was fairly pleased with it. I just went through the rest of the view files and made sure each of them looked good, and when sized didn't completely mess up.
