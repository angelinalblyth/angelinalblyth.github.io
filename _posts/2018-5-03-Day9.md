## Moving on    

So I finished the CSS course on codecademy today while in work as it was a slow day in the config team.

There was an event on at work which I attended all do to with UC, Microsoft Teams and Plantronics. I didn't really hang around much after it as I knew no one apart from my colleagues and also I had to get home to study some.

I wont be doing much coding this weekend because I will be up in Aberdeen visiting the other half and I will finally get to see the new Avengers, been spoil free so far *happy dance*. So I will probably miss a few days but pick it back up Sunday or Monday.

Need to get my wpm into Kat @ CodeClan so off to do that now. I'll try and update this with the latest results.
