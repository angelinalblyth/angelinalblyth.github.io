## 4 Principles and SOLID

I woke up this morning thinking about the course and why I was doing it. The whole reason I started the course has shifted on week 4 and I genuinely did not want to go in this morning. But I got up and I managed to get to class in time even if I wasn't there mentally.

Today we covered a lot more. We went through Abstract classes, inheritance and touched on packages. We went over how a shop can have both Volunteers and Managers but they are both Employees. They each have some of the same features but can have different methods in each, for instance a Manager would get paid but perhaps a volunteer would not.

So glad to not have homework this evening. Jack one of the students actually put on a pub quiz for the two classes and it was really fun. I had Debi and Craig in my team and we obviously won. Nothing to do with me, I am horrible at quizzes.

At 6pm we had a talk from Richard Lennonx, who is an ex CEO of Skyscanner. Was interesting to hear when he had to say about the tech community and some tips on how to come across at interviews.
