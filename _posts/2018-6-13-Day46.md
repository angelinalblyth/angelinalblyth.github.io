## Handing in our Projects

So we had all morning to fine tune our projects. I got some help on something I wanted to happen on a specific page. John kindly helped me with that and I was able to commit that and get a feature I had wanted since Friday to actually happen.

I managed to commit my 101th commit to Github right on the 12pm deadline which was great.

Had a bit of one-on-one with one of the instructors, mines being Colin, to go through out project and see if there was anything they spotted that could have been changed. Mines didn't really have much to change, perhaps change my 'edit' buttons on the edit page to 'save'. That was it.  

The rest of the day was spent working on our presentations, and I also worked on them throughout the night too. I also spent way to long trying to decide what my song would be for my walk to the top of the class for tomorrow's presentations. I enlisted in some help from friends but I ultimately decided to go for [Edge's Theme Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rhLTg6M7A) from Wrestling. Was honestly one of the hardest things these past week :) if you can believe that.
