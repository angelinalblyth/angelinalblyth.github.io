## Competition Time

Spent today lifting weights over in Alloa for a Grassroots Competition. The day went well and I was happy with all three lifts. Did mean I didnt get any coding practice in but cant code 24/7. 

Also seen my friend Cyn off from her travels in Scotland. I am sure she is looking forward to getting home to see her family and it was lovely spending time with her. 

Tomorrow is a new day and Ill get back to learning Ruby.
