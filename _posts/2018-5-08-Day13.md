## Back to work  

Back to work today and I didnt really get a chance to do any studying. Count down is on to me leaving the IT Dept so I have been busy writing processes and making sure I have a handover to give to my replacements. 

I got into the Udacity Bertelsmann Data Science Scholarship Course. Started it last night. Think it will be good to work through it all. I highly doubt I will get put through to the second part but hopefully the first part gives me a good idea of statistics and Data Science. It looks like it uses SQL and Python which is good as I know SQL and I just purchased the Python Dev Bundle off of Humble Bundle.
