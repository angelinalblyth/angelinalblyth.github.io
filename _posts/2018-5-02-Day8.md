## CSS Images  

Finished the command line course on codecademy and started on the CSS course. I have also been using the solo learn app on my phone in the mornings while traveling to work and the ruby course on that is starting to sink in a little.

Going to power through the rest of the recommended pre course work and get onto other ruby courses.
