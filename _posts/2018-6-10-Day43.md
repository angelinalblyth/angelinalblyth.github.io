## That one error   

So most of today consisted of staring at my screen looking at the same error. No one at the library could really figure out what was going on. I reached out to one of the instructors and they managed to get me through the error only to create a new one and another one and finally the last one. Nothing that was being told to me was going in, this was pretty late in the afternoon so I think my brain had just stopped working.

Leaving that error until tomorrow when I can go over it in person with someone. So I started my HTML and CSS for each of the erb files and where I wanted certain things from the database to be displayed.

Pretty please with how much I had done so far.
