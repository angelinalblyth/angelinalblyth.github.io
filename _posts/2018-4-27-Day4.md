## Typing Speeds

Didn't take the mac to work and I actually have quiet periods during the day...go figure.

Sent my wpm over to Kat @ CodeClan.

Managed to get 82 wpm on normal typing and 44 wpm on the ruby section. Not too shabby, just need to keep it up.

Set up trello and put in all the links in each section so I keep track of everything. Managed to move a fair bit into the 'done' section.
