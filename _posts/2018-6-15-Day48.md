## Day off - but still learning

So I still headed into the CodeClan office today to attend a talk from [Software Advisory Service](https://www.softwareadvisoryservice.com/) based here in Glasgow. It was by two former students at CodeClan, Sam and Danny. Sam was part of E5 over in Edinburgh and Danny was from G4 here in Glasgow. Sam has been working for SAS for just over a year and Danny has only been there for two week.

Was lovely to see these two so enthusiastic about their employer and how they know that people coming in from CodeClan are hardworking and are always wanting to learn.

Rest of the day has been about catching up with this blog post.

Don't know if I will do much over the weekend apart from what John suggested and going over some OOP basics, perhaps put my site on Heroku if I can follow the instruction Collin sent out over slack.

Glad week 5 is over.
