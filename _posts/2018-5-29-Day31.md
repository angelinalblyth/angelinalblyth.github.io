## Putting things together  

So all day today we spent time putting our new sql statements into ruby and figuring out how they can both interact with each other.

We started off by making pizza shop and in it some pizza orders. We created the tables for the pizza orders and then with ruby created our pizza order class. We went through CRUD to create, read, update and delete these pizza orders from the tables using sql and ruby.

Finding this great, and its good to see how the two are coming together.

This afternoons lab was to make a table for tracking bounties for Space Cowboys, we had to pick four properties for our tables and go through CRUD for the table. We then had to do some other methods like find_by_name.

Again I enjoyed doing this, be good when we are building more and more tables and seeing how they all link together.

Tonights homework was to look at either Netflix, Instagram or the BBC News site and think of the tables that these places would use to hold all the information and then try and build relationships out of them.

I went through the rabbit hole of google and found a lot out about Instagram, they even have a Tumblr page for their engineers which I have bookmarked for future reading.
