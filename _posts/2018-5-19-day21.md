## Studying while getting some new ink!

Spent today getting two new tattoos, with the placement hurt a fair bit. While I was on the table getting tattoed I spent sometime on [FreeCodeCamp](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/map) and trying to remember any of the Javascript I had learned before beginning Ruby, result is I cant.

I gave up half way through getting tattooed because of the way I had to lie for the artist to get to my shins, so I put away the laptop.

Leaving the parlour I decided it was too nice a day to sit in and code so I ended up spending sometime with friends who I had neglected for a few weeks.
