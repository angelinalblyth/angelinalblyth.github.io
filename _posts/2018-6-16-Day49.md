## Heroku and Breaking Stuff  

So spent today with the family but on the way down to theirs I followed the Heroku instructions for my project. Big mistake, now none of my ruby items run. I have tried googling the error message and nothing!

I think it must have been the gem that was installed but not to sure.

Going to see if one of the instructors can take a look at it next week.

Going to take tomorrow off so Day 50 will be on Monday.
